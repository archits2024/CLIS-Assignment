Question 4 – Explanations

1. System Uptime Verification
The uptime command was used to display how long the system has been running since the last boot, along with the number of logged-in users and the system load average.

2. User Process Listing
The ps -u $(whoami) command was used to list all processes currently running under the logged-in user account.

3. CPU Usage Analysis
The top command was used to monitor running processes in real time and identify the process consuming the highest CPU usage among the user’s processes.

4. Background Process Execution
A command (sleep 300) was started in the background using &, and its execution was verified using the job and process information.

5. Process Priority Management
The priority (niceness) of the background process was changed using the renice command, and the updated priority value was verified using the ps command.

6. Memory Usage Monitoring
The free -h command was used to display system memory usage in a human-readable format, including total, used, free, and available memory.

7. Disk Space Inspection
The df -h command was used to display disk space usage of the filesystem where the home directory resides, showing total, used, and available space.

8. Shell Identification
The $SHELL environment variable was displayed to identify the currently active shell, which is /bin/bash.

9. Output Redirection
The output of the uname -a system information command was redirected into a file named system_report.txt and verified by displaying the file contents.

10. Disk Usage Visualization
The du -h --max-depth=1 command was used to visualize disk usage of directories within the home directory, showing how much space each subdirectory occupies.
