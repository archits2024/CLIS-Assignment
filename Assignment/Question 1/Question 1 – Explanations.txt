Question 1 – Explanations
1. User Identity Verification (whoami, groups)

I used the whoami command to display my currently logged-in username.
I used the groups command to show all the groups my user account belongs to.

2. Workspace Validation (pwd, ls -l)

The pwd command shows the current working directory I am in.
The ls -l command lists all files and directories with detailed information.

3. Environment Confirmation File (echo > user_info.txt)

This command creates a file named user_info.txt and writes the confirmation message into it.

4. File Integrity Check (wc -c user_info.txt)

The wc -c command displays the total number of characters present in the file.

5. Learning the Tools (man mkdir)

The manual page for mkdir was checked.
The -p option allows creating parent directories automatically if they do not exist.

6. Home Directory Inspection (ls ~ | sort)

This command lists all files and directories in my home directory in alphabetical order.

7. Log Investigation (grep "admin" log.txt)

The grep command searches for the word “admin” inside the log.txt file and displays matching lines.

8. System Information Check (uname -r)

The uname -r command displays the Linux kernel version currently running on the system.

9. Network Connectivity Test (ping -c 4 www.google.com)

The ping command was used to test network connectivity.
The destination was unreachable because ICMP traffic is restricted in the lab environment.

10. System Health Awareness (uptime)

The uptime command shows how long the system has been running, the number of logged-in users, and the system load average.
