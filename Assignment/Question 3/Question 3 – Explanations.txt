Question 3 – Explanations
1. File Creation
The file sample_data.txt was created in the home directory and sample text was written into it to demonstrate basic file creation and content writing.

2. Hard Link Creation
A hard link named sample_hard.txt was created using the ln command. This hard link points to the same data on disk as sample_data.txt.

3. Symbolic Link Creation
A symbolic (soft) link named sample_soft.txt was created using the ln -s command. This link references the original file by its file path.

4. Inode Verification
The inode numbers of sample_data.txt, sample_hard.txt, and sample_soft.txt were displayed using the ls -i command to compare how Linux tracks files.

5. Inode Analysis
sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode number because hard links reference the same inode and data blocks.
sample_soft.txt has a different inode because it is a separate file that stores only the path to the original file.

6. File Metadata Inspection
Detailed file information of sample_data.txt was displayed using long listing format, showing permissions, ownership, link count, file size, and timestamps.

7. Disk Usage Check
The total disk usage of the home directory was displayed in a human-readable format to show how much space it occupies.

8. File Size Overview
All files and directories in the home directory were listed along with their sizes in a human-readable format.

9. Link Deletion Test
The symbolic link sample_soft.txt was deleted, and it was verified that the original file sample_data.txt still exists, confirming that deleting a soft link does not affect the original file.

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
The du -h command was used to display the disk usage of sample_data.txt, showing the actual space used by the file.
The df -h command was used to display filesystem-level disk usage, including total size, used space, available space, and usage percentage.
du reports file and directory usage, while df reports filesystem capacity and availability.
