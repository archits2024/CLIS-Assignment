Question 3 – Explanations
1. File Creation
A file named sample_data.txt was created in the home directory, and sample text was added to demonstrate basic file creation and content writing.

2. Hard Link Creation
A hard link named sample_hard.txt was created for sample_data.txt. Both filenames now point to the same data block on disk.

3. Symbolic Link Creation
A symbolic (soft) link named sample_soft.txt was created, which references the original file using its file path.

4. Inode Verification
The inode numbers of sample_data.txt, sample_hard.txt, and sample_soft.txt were displayed to observe how Linux tracks files internally.

5. Inode Analysis
sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode number because a hard link refers to the same inode and data.
sample_soft.txt has a different inode because it only stores the path to the original file.

6. File Metadata Inspection
Detailed file information of sample_data.txt was displayed, including permissions, ownership, file size, and timestamps.

7. Disk Usage Check
The disk usage of the home directory was displayed in a human-readable format to understand how much space it occupies.

8. File Size Overview
The sizes of all files and directories in the home directory were listed in a human-readable format.

9. Link Deletion Test
The symbolic link sample_soft.txt was deleted and it was verified that sample_data.txt remained unaffected, proving that deleting a soft link does not remove the original file.

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
The du command was used to display disk usage of directories (for example, total size of the home directory).
The df command was used to display filesystem-level disk usage, showing total, used, and available disk space.
Together, du shows directory usage, while df shows filesystem capacity and availability.
