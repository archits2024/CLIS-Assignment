Question 3 – Explanations

1. File Creation
A file named sample_data.txt was created in the home directory and sample text was added to it to demonstrate basic file creation.

2. Hard Link Creation
A hard link named sample_hard.txt was created for sample_data.txt, pointing to the same data on disk.

3. Symbolic Link Creation
A symbolic link named sample_soft.txt was created, which references the original file by its name.

4. Inode Verification
The inode numbers of the original file, hard link, and symbolic link were displayed to compare how Linux tracks files.

5. Inode Analysis
The original file and the hard link share the same inode number because they reference the same data, while the symbolic link has a different inode as it only points to the file path.

6. File Metadata Inspection
Detailed information such as permissions, ownership, file size, and timestamps of sample_data.txt was displayed.

7. Disk Usage Check
The total disk space used by the home directory was displayed in a human-readable format.

8. File Size Overview
All files and directories in the home directory were listed along with their sizes in a readable format.

9. Link Deletion Test
The symbolic link was deleted and the original file was verified to still exist, proving that deleting a soft link does not affect the original file.

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
Disk usage commands were used to show how much space the file occupies and how storage is utilized on the filesystem.
